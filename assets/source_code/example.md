You can launch a new career in web develop-ment today by learning HTML & CSS. You don't need a computer science degree or expensive software. All you need is a computer, a bit of time, a lot of determination, and a teacher you trust.

This is some code:

```
class MyClass {
 final String name = "Paul";
}
```
